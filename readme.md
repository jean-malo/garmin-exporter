Export waypoints and tracking data created by a Garmin inreach device into csv or json files.

## Getting started

Simply run the following commands in a terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:jeanmalod/garmin-exporter.git
```

```
python3 kmlexporter.py -i <path-to-the-kml-feed> -o <name-of-output-file>
```

*Note : the easiest way to gather your kml feed is to head over to https://inreach.garmin.com/Map and select the export button.*
